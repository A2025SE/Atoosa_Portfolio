                    <p>My name is Atoosa Falsafi, and I am currently employed as a news graphic designer at SVT, where I work on various TV programs and news broadcasts aimed at different target audiences. I also have experience working with intranets, maintaining direct communication with clients, and understanding how different editorial teams collaborate to produce programs. I studied the IT, Media, and Design program at Södertörn University, which focused on the creation of digital content, graphic design, UX design, and web design.
